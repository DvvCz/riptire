# riptire
> A lightweight invidious client.

**What you miss out on with Invidious**
- Youtube's Sleek UI
- Subscriptions

**What you gain from Invidious**
- Liberation from Google
- A performant experience (~6x less memory usage!)

Riptire aims to bring both of these together, to make the switch off YouTube painless.
This isn't some electron wrapper either, which ends up using even more RAM than youtube.
